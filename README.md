This is a Gradle project. I was able to successfully load it into IntelliJ IDEA using its defaults. Eclipse, who knows, it won't even start on me at this point, but it should similarly work using the Gradle Buildship plugin.

Worst case, it's only two source files, and you could consider creating the project from scratch if you have any issues.
